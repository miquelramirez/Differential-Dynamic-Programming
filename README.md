# Differential-Dynamic-Programming

This repo includes starter code and a brief overview on differential dynamic programming (DDP) for operating your own autonomous helicopter! Well, at least to help you start implementing the code for this paper, [An Application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight](http://heli.stanford.edu/papers/nips06-aerobatichelicopter.pdf).

* Getting Started
* DDP

## Paper Highlights

* Three key steps: 1) gather human pilot data, 2) find controller in simulation based on model, 2) test on helicopter (iterate as necessary)

## Resources

* Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto) - nice introduction to dynamic programming
* [Differential Dynamic Programming for Optimal Estimation](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/pubs/Kobilarov15icra.pdf) - helpful article
* Steve Brunton's awesome [Control Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw)
